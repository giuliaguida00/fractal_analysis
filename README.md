# Fractal Analysis
This code aims to perform the fractal analysis of contour of closed or open ontlines. Fractal analysis provides several new non-dimensional quantitative morphology descriptors over the range of experimentally accessible scales.   

## The Method
Fractal analysis stemps from the observation that the measured length of the contour of many natural irregular closed shapes, $p$, is a function of the measurement scale, $b$ (Mandelbrot, 1967), and that smaller the measurement scale, the longer the measured length becomes. The approximations with segments of length $b$ of stricly self-similar mathematical curves, such as $e.g.$ the Koch snowflake (von Koch, 1906), have lengths: 
$p=b^{1-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is the Hausdorff dimension, assuming values between 1 and 2. The aformentioned equation implies that the length of the contour of any truly-fractal closed shape deiverges to infinity as the measurement scale tends to zero. When dealing with physical objects, indefinite subdivision of space does not make sense, as the minimum measurement scale would be limited at least by the distance at the atomic level, while in practice, well before this is achieved, it is limited by the experimental resolution with which the contour of the particle is defined. However, the plot of $p$, $versus$ measurement scale $b$, still carries a signature of the morphology of the object contour over the range of experimentally accessible scales. 
The input for the fractal analysis is a 2D binary image of the object (white pixels for the object of interest and black background) of any resolution, as obtained by processing optical or scanning electron microscopy for example. It is evident that the higher the resolution of the image, the more information can be extracted from the analysis.

# Particles' contour
At the upper end of this range, the characteristic dimension of the particle can be conventionally defned as the diameter of the circle having the same area as the particle: $D=\sqrt{4A/\pi}$.
Figure 1.1a shows schematically a binarized particle image after segmentation, in which white pixels correspond to the particle while black pixels correspond to the background.
The contour of the particle can be extracted by subtracting from the binarized image of the particle its 8th-connected eroded, to obtain the external line of 8th-connected pixels (Fig. 1.1b) in the form of a vector containing their coordinates ($x_i$; $y_i$).
The algorithm, coded in Matlab (2015), computes the length of the contour adopting segments of fixed length (Figure 1.1c-d). A point of the contour is chosen as the starting point for the calculation (Fig. 1.1c) and one end of a segment of length $b$ is fixed to it. A simple "while" loop, which stops when the distance between the starting point and a successive point on the boundary is greater than or equal to $b$, finds the intersection point between the other end of the segment and the boundary (Fig. 1.1c). In turn, this intersection point becomes the starting point for the second segment, until the whole contour is covered (Fig. 1.1d). Since a finite number of points discretize the outline, the exact distance between two subsequent intersection points is not strictly equal to the segment length $b$, but the maximum error is less than the pixel size. The loop ends when the distance between the
intersection point and the initial starting point is less than $b$ (Fig. 1.1e). The length of the contour is computed as the sum of the distances between all the intersection points. As this length depends on the chosen initial starting point (Stachowiak 1998), consistently with the definition of the Hausdorff dimension, the procedure is repeated using all the points of the boundary as starting points, and the perimeter of the particle, $p$, is defined as the minimum computed value of the length of the contour.
Finally, the normalised perimeter, $p=D$, is plotted versus the corresponding normalised stick length, $b=D$, in a bi-logarithmic plane.
